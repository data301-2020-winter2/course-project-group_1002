2. RQ2: What are top 5 artists in terms of the count of song releases?
3. RQ3: What are the trends and interrelationships of major and minor keys

## Summary and Conclusions for My Research Questions

- **Research Question 1:** Within the artists that posted the top 5 most popular songs, who has the most number of song releases? 

    - Summary of findings: accoring to the plot from 2.9.5., the artists that posted the top 5 most popular songs are Sia, Ariana Grande, Pop Smoke, iann dior, and Olivia Rodrigo. Among them, Ariana Grande has released much more songs than any of the other artists.
    - Insight: Ariana Grande is very popular recently and I guess that is why this phenomenon happens.
    - Conclusions: Within the artists that posted the top 5 most popular songs, Ariana Grande has the most number of song releases.
    

- **Research Question 2:** What are top 5 artists in terms of the count of song releases?
    - Summary of findings: according to the plot from 2.9.1., the qualified artists are Francisco Canaro, Tadeusz Dolega Mostowicz, Эрнест Хемингуэй,Эрих Мария Ремарк, and Frédéric Chopin.
    - Insight: to be subjective, I have heard the names of most of them, and Frédéric Chopin is one of my favorite artists.
    - Conclusions: the top 5 artists in terms of the count of song releases are Francisco Canaro, Tadeusz Dolega Mostowicz, Эрнест Хемингуэй,Эрих Мария Ремарк, and Frédéric Chopin.
    
- **Research Question 3:** What are the trends and interrelationships of major and minor mode
    - Summary of findings: according to the plot from 2.9.2, both the amount of releases of major keys and that of minor keys are gradually increasing. Moreover, in each decade, the total release of the major key is much greater than that of the minor key. According to the plot from 2.9.3, all the keys except B have more major mode released than minor mode.
    - Insight: in my opinion, since major keys promote positive emotions and are widely accepted, more release is reasonable.
    - Conclusions: 
        1. Both the amount of releases of major keys and that of minor keys are gradually increasing 
        2. The total release of the major key is much greater than that of the minor key.
        3. Most keys have more major mode released than minor mode released
