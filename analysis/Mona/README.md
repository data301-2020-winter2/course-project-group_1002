*Research Question 1: I am interested in finding out the change in **danceability** and **energy** of songs based on the year of release, and whether there is any correlation between danceability of and energy of songs.

  *Findings: Based on my plots in milestone 2, danceability and energy of songs has been steadily increasing since after the 50s. There is no strong correlation between danceability and energy levels of songs. This is reasonable as danceability can also refer to different types of dancing, which includes a variety range of energy. It is interesting to see that danceability and energy of songs have been steadily increasing, This may be attributed to the rise of Hippie and party cultures.
