    "This means that $m^2$ is divisible by 5.  By the **Fact from Ex 7.7.**, $m$ must be divisible by $5$.  So, we can write $m = 5k$ where $k$ is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then the equality  $5n^2=m^2$ turns into $5n^2=(5k)^2=25k^2=5(5k^2)$.  So, we have $n^2=5k^2$ and thus $n^2$ is divisible by 5.  Again, by the **Fact from Ex 7.7.**, we deduce that $n$ must be divisible by $5$. We then write $n = 5l$, for some integer $l$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this leads to a contradiction since $m$ and $n$ now have a common factor which is 5.\n",
