Music is a universal element that is present in all culture, and brings pleasure to most people. By using the Spotify Dataset, we are looking to investigate the shift in music taste throughout the years, as music taste changes under the influence of new technology, political movements, social media, and many other factors. Through this analytic project, we aim to analyze the evolution of music taste by exploring the common elements in popular songs, the general musical trend during specific eras, and identifying the most popular artists, genres, and individual songs during different times. Moreover, we are also interested in finding a general pattern that can help us predict future musical trends. The overall goal is to create a dashboard to visualize the data and present the shift in musical preference over the last 100 years. We hope to use this project as an opportunity to demonstrate the different music genres and elements that are favoured between different generations.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

(Draft)
The Spotify dataset has been obtained from Kaggle, a data science community where public datasets are available for use. It is courtesy of Yamac Eren Ay, a Data Scientist from Berlin and a passionate music listener. It contains data on audio features of more than 175,000 songs released in between 1921 and 2021 collected using the Spotify Web API. The noteworthy features include acousticness, danceability, energy, popularity, tempo, and speechiness. In addition, songs are categorised by key, artists, release date, and name. The ‘id’ field uniquely identifies the observations.   

This dataset has been created to serve the scientific exploration of the evolution in music tastes.
