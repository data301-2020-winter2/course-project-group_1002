(Draft)
The Spotify dataset has been obtained from Kaggle, and is a courtesy of Yamac Eren Ay, a Data Scientist from Berlin. It contains data on audio features of more than 175,000 songs released in between 1921 and 2021 collected using the Spotify Web API. The noteworthy features include acousticness, danceability, energy, popularity, tempo, and speechiness. In addition, songs are categorised by key, artists, release date, and name. The ‘id’ field uniquely identifies the observations.   

This dataset has been created to serve the scientific exploration of the evolution in music tastes.
