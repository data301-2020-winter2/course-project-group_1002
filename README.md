## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Music is a universal element that is present in all cultures, and which brings pleasure to most people. 

By using the Spotify Dataset, we seek to investigate the shifts in musical taste throughout the years as musical preferences change under the influence of new technology, political movements, social media, and many other factors. Through this analytic project, we aim to analyze the evolution of musical taste by exploring the common elements in popular songs, investigating the general musical trend during specific eras, and by identifying the most popular artists, genres, and individual songs during different times. Moreover, we are also interested in finding a general pattern that can help us predict future musical trends. The overall goal is to create a dashboard to visualize the data and to present the shift in musical preference over the last 100 years. Finally, we hope to use this project as an opportunity to illustrate the different music genres and elements that are favoured by different generations.

(Draft)
The Spotify dataset has been obtained from Kaggle, a data science community where public datasets are available for use. It is courtesy of Yamac Eren Ay, a Data Scientist from Berlin and a passionate music listener. This dataset has been created to serve the scientific exploration of the evolution of musical tastes.  
It contains data on audio features of more than 175,000 songs released  between 1921 and 2021 collected using the Spotify Web API. The noteworthy features include acousticness, danceability, energy, popularity, tempo, and speechiness. In addition, songs are categorized by key, artists, release date, and name. The ‘id’ field uniquely identifies the observations.   

The dataset contains five files. ‘data.csv’ is the main file, and the other ones were created using data from this file. While the numerical values - acousticness, danceability, energy, valence, instrumentalness, speechiness, tempo, loudness, duration_ms, liveness, and popularity – were obtained by calculating the mean of the values obtained from the API, categorical features such as ‘key’ and ‘mode’ were obtained by calculating the mode of the values. Moreover, ‘popularity’ is based on US data, not worldwide data, and this could potentially limit the scope of the analysis.
